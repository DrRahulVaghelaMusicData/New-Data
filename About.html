        <h1 itemprop="Text" class="Subheaders">What do we serve to community</h1>

        <p itemprop="Text" class="SUbheadword">
            Theme Based Music composition work through stories written behind the notes of sounds before executing it into a sound mould. Its like work starts from imagination of stories or real life stories into musical transformation with our visions. Difference
            is that I am a composer using basic sound note knowledge base with the twist of technology to modulate final outcome according to story base in the musical work. Believing to living in a present moment with the vision of dreams makes me feel
            alive to keep composing new music work with the ease regardless of what some community percept that work as how! learning is a good thing in life for me as I always learn new things to make life easier in terms of personal growth. That reflects
            to my new releases as always love to do new things or old things in a new way. Initially called as mood music as that works on different emotions which are reffered to as moods. Stories,Emotions,notes arrangements & composing a new music sets
            make feel good.

        <h1 itemprop="Text" class="Subheaders">How Do We compose Music?</h1>




        <p itemprop="Text" class="SUbheadword"> Generating real time music playing from self made technologies and some developer help from the open source community for sounds and by means its too much time consuming but will make it quicker in future soon. As this is design to compose each
            note with different scale and key in different sphere space location just like real world live recording. Playing and arranging notes according to feel and emotions involved in the story base to make it live. The fun part is that it has only
            two chanels stereo but still gives you spatial effects because of the working on each musical note from the scratch. No use of lot of synths but some basic softwares which are open source like for example AUDACITY. Constructive way of arranging
            and playing notes with various human playable tempos (e.g CDEFGA) is how we do raw music. Soon will share Sheets of Work for anyone to play & perform.</p>


        <h1 itemprop="Text" class="Subheaders">What is the most useful tool to us </h1>
        <p itemprop="Text" class="SUbheadword">
            Any Score notation Software is the most useful to us in productions because it helps to improve work efficiency in dynamics & articulations while mastering. If you are new then start with open source Notation softwares like Musescore & if you feel comfortable
            with complex tools then go with any commercial DAW with Notations as they have all things included with notations , vsts, effects or more. Some people dont need this notations but we prefer because that way you find constructions in notes
            but again its about how you like things in productions. you just need some basic knowledge in notations like your keys, clefs , chords, tempo , dynamics, articulations etc. Once that has been learned , it becomes easier to play your Composition.
