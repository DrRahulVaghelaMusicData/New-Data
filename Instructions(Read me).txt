####How to play music files once it is downloaded .

/--files are securely encrypted on the source drive when you click on the link 


/--once you have downloaded the file you would have either direct audio file with file extensions of audio like wav, flac, ogg but if you get file extensions like .bin . conf or anything like that then you need to manually change file name and extensions to any audio formats then you are good to go .

/--this process is created only to keep files safe from non human bot source controls so you don't get bad files .

/--Instead you get clean virus free files.

/--we trust to put big files 
on mega.nz because it also protects copyright infringement of materials on internet. 

/--sounds are varying in formats and bit depths so always check your final mix when you use these sounds as they are all high qualities and some might not support your small speakers and will need complete studio setup to mix properly for your song.---///

/---use higher quality headphones are alternatives with more than stereo chanels are sweet if you have one--//

/---in old devices/windows7, if you dont have updated apps with decoding softwares for the sounds then  they might not sound as they are supposed to. Windows 8 or later has newer in built audio codecs & updated MAC  is fine.--//

/---all music is solely composed from the base scratch only by myself so I can spare some of the work for free for all on free website and free for all (only to play nonexclusively) as in terms of downloads ---none of these music or any part of the work will be in my any of the music releses on the stores so its good in that sense.---//

/--stay safe--//
